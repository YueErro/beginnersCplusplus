## C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners

Free online course available at [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/free-learn-c-tutorial-beginners/).
This repository includes the code and the CMakeLists.txt for each exercise.

To try it out you will have to compile the package:
```sh
cd ~/beginnersCplusplus/allocating-memory
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
And run it:
```sh
./allocating-memory
```

*To try out a different package, follow the same procedure, but change `allocating-memory` with the name of the package you want to try this time.*
